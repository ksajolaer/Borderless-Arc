# Automated Borderless Arc app for testing is now available at [here](https://github.com/ksajolaer/Borderless-Arc/releases/tag/testing)! However, if you still want to do it yourself, proceed with the guide below.

### Guide for Borderless Arc Browser, tested on latest version of macOS Ventura, Sonoma, Sequoia and Arc.

*Here is the **[demo video](https://youtu.be/9Rslrgrj42g)**.*

**Step 1.** Run the `killall Dock` command on repeat (*or else Dock will restart again*), I use `watch` for this.

    watch -n0.1 killall Dock

**Step 2.** Fullscreen Arc window. Arc should now stay windowed with fullscreen UI.

*As you can see, Arc does not have close, minimize and fullscreen buttons as it normally has.*

**Note: Remember to ‚åÉC after done fullscreen Arc.**

**Step 3.** Hide sidebar and enjoy your borderless Arc!
