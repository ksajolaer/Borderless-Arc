### Automated Borderless Arc app for testing is now available at [here](https://github.com/ksajolaer/Borderless-Arc/releases/tag/testing)! 

**[Demo video](https://youtu.be/9Rslrgrj42g)**

**In order to use the Borderless Arc app, remember to allow zsh to access Privacy and Security (Accessibility and Automation) options as shown here**.


**Step 1.** Run the `killall Dock` command on repeat (*or else Dock will restart again*), I use `watch` for this.

    watch -n0.1 killall Dock

**Step 2.** Fullscreen Arc window. Arc should now stay windowed with fullscreen UI.

*As you can see, Arc does not have close, minimize and fullscreen buttons as it normally has.*

**Note: Remember to ‚åÉC after done fullscreen Arc.**

**Step 3.** Hide sidebar and enjoy your borderless Arc!
