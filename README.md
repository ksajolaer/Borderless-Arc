# Guide for Borderless Arc Browser
### Tested on latest version of macOS Ventura, Sonoma, Sequoia and Arc.
*Here is the **[demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_hSZyi64VY)**.*

**Step 1.** Run the `killall Dock` command on repeat (*or else Dock will restart again*), I use `watch` for this.

    watch -n0.1 killall Dock

**Step 2.** Fullscreen Arc window. Arc should now stay windowed with fullscreen UI.

*As you can see, Arc does not have close, minimize and fullscreen buttons as it normally has.*

**Step 3.** Hide sidebar and enjoy your borderless Arc!
